### History of the Site

Since 2012 I have had my personal website at ChrisOffline.com and its files were hosted by the same company that sold me the domain. Owning ChrisOffline was a great experience. Over the years it taught me PHP, mySQL, CSS, HMTL, design, and really how the internet works.

Four and a half years later, after realizing that I didn't really need a database for my personal website and that I was seriously overpaying for hosting I decided to move to a static website.

Now everything is hosted on GitHub. I ditched the database, PHP, and who would have guessed, the code is actually a lot cleaner.
