					<span class="projects-section-title">About My Projects</span>
					<p class="projects-about-text">Although I've done a fair amount of coding in PHP, ASP.NET, Python, C, and C++, most of the work you will find
						here was made either with JavaScript or with Java. The web projects will all run in the browser, but you may need to update
						Java on your computer to run the simulations or games. If a project does not open because it is from an unidentified developer, just right click and
						select Open.</p>
					<p class="projects-about-text">Some of the projects here are years old, so note the dates next to the project names to see how far I've come!
						I hope you find something here you like!</p>

						<p class="project-description">ChrisOffline.com was my first personal website. I bought the domain in 2012 to teach myself HTML and CSS.
							I soon realized I would need to learn PHP to make the kind of website I wanted, so it was all in PHP for four years.
							In 2016 I rebuilt the whole thing with React. The site has been through many iterations and has taught me a lot of what I know about web development.</p>

						<p class="project-description">I was interested in the idea that a 3D world could be projected onto a 2D screen
							and that large worlds could be created using only triangles. This was my attempt at creating my own 3D world.
							This was made with close to no knowledge of vector math or the power of modern graphics engines.
							Use W,A,S,D to move around, space to jump, the mouse to look around, and the number keys for different visual effects.</p>

						</div>
						<span class="project-date">7 • 2016</span>
						<p class="project-description">This was a short project that I worked on trying to help out my friends at
							<a class="project-text-link" href="http://fyrno.com" target="_blank">Fyrno</a>, a music discovery app that helps you find
							new music from up-and-coming artists. I used the SoundCloud API and a few Python libraries to group similar users
						 	and artists in order to create genre labels without looking at song metadata. I then used graph visualization software
							to show how SoundCloud genres cluster.</p>

						<div class="project-header">
							<span class="project-title">Scheduler HD</span>
						</div>
						<span class="project-date">8 • 2013</span>
						<p class="project-description">I worked with a friend after our junior year of high school to create a
							web application that let students share their schedules and compare teachers and free periods.
							Students could make accounts, add friends, and easily find common free periods. We started and finished the site in
							just a few weeks so that we could go live before classes started.</p>

							<span class="project-title">Park Tudor Chemical Database</span>
						</div>
						<span class="project-date">5 • 2013</span>
						<p class="project-description">The science department at my high school requested an online inventory
							of chemicals in storage. I worked with two other students in my Dynamic Web Development class to build this project
							over the course of a semester. The project is now used in my high school to clear expired chemicals off shelves,
						  	alert the science department when chemicals are about to expire so more can be purchased, and automatically
							send teachers safety information by email when they use hazardous chemicals from storage. QR codes on bottles are
							scanned by mobile phone and a desktop web portal can be accessed by the science department chair to view all of the
							database information.</p>

							<span class="project-title">Vector</span>
						</div>
						<span class="project-date">5 • 2012</span>
						<p class="project-description">Vector was an online multiplayer game made with Java sockets. Players would connect to
							a server through LAN and login with secure credentials. Users could customize their account and talk with friends in
							a chat room. From there users could challenge friends to a game where they would try to knock each other's marbles off of a table.
							Records of wins and losses were kept for each user to be accessed whenever they logged in.</p>
