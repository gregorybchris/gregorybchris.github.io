					<span class="projects-section-title">About My Projects</span>
					<p class="projects-about-text">Although I've done a fair amount of coding in PHP, ASP.NET, Python, C, and C++, most of the work you will find
						here was made either with JavaScript or with Java. The web projects will all run in the browser, but you may need to update
						Java on your computer to run the simulations or games.</p>
					<p class="projects-about-text">Some of the projects here are years old, so note the dates next to the project names to see how far I've come!
						I hope you find something here you like!

						<span class="project-title">Chan's Algorithm</span>
						<span class="project-date">12 • 20 • 2016</span>
						<p class="project-description">Chan's algorithm is an optimal output-sensitive algorithm for computing the
							convex hull of a pointset in <i>O(nlogh)</i> time where <i>n</i> is the total number of points and <i>h</i> is the number of hull points.
							This is a graphical walkthrough of the algorithm made with D3.js that I made for my computational geometry class.</p>

						<span class="project-title">ChrisOffline</span>
						<span class="project-date">7 • 12 • 2016</span>
						<p class="project-description">ChrisOffline.com was my old website that I made with mySQL and PHP in the backend and React for the UI.
							This was my primary website for seven years and over its many iterations taught me a lot of what I know about web development.</p>

						<span class="project-date">3 • 10 • 2016</span>
						<p class="project-description">Dining halls at Tufts operate under what is far from a perfect system. It is very easy to overpay
							for a meal plan and most students do it every semester. This is meal plan calculator that optimizes
							total cost based on eating habits. Savings are theoretically on the order of hundreds of dollars.</p>

					<div class="project-wrap">
						<span class="project-title">Base</span>
						<span class="project-date">1 • 21 • 2013</span>
						<p class="project-description">A numerical base conversion calculator. It converts between all bases from binary to hexatridecimal.
							The web page includes a short explanation of the theory behind number systems.</p>

						<span class="project-date">4 • 4 • 2015</span>
						<p class="project-description">Over the years there have been many versions of this game.
							There are sixteen letters. You have one minute to find all possible words by swiping over the letters.
							Press R to restart the game when your minute it up.</p>

					<div class="project-wrap">
						<span class="project-title">Tiles</span>
						<span class="project-date">12 • 10 • 2013</span>
						<p class="project-description">This is an original game that was inspired by several online games I played as a child.
							Move your piece around the board so that you hit every tile exactly once. The levels get harder as you go, so try to beat them all.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="project-wrap">
						<span class="project-title">Tower of Hanoi</span>
						<span class="project-date">7 • 10 • 2013</span>
						<p class="project-description">Another classic game, Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle where you try to move all disks from the first peg to the third.
							However, disks can only be placed on disks bigger than themselves and you can only move one disk at a time.
							Press the equals key to check your high scores, the R key to restart, the number keys to change the level.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="project-wrap">
						<span class="project-title">Armada</span>
						<span class="project-date">1 • 1 • 2013</span>
						<p class="project-description">Armada is a two player race to treasure on the open sea. The game uses somewhat unconventional physics to
							challenge reflexes and strategy. Arrow keys control the red ship and W, S, and D keys control the blue ship.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="project-wrap">
						<span class="project-title">Evolution</span>
						<span class="project-date">5 • 26 • 2012</span>
						<p class="project-description">This was one of the first graphical games I ever made. Use the arrow keys to select the element type and pen size,
							then click or drag on the screen to experiment with the elements.</p>

						<span class="project-title">Directed</span>
						<span class="project-date">12 • 13 • 2014</span>
						<p class="project-description">Directed is a force directed graph simulation. Click on the screen to add nodes.
							Drag between two nodes to create an edge. Press R to restart the simulation or press G to create a new random graph.
							The F button will toggle spring forces.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="project-wrap">
						<span class="project-title">3D World</span>
						<span class="project-date">8 • 1 • 2014</span>
						<p class="project-description">I was interested in the idea that a 3D world could be projected onto a 2D screen
							and that large worlds could be created using only triangles. This was my attempt at creating my own 3D world.
							This was made with close to no knowledge of vector math or the power of modern graphics libraries.
							Use W,A,S,D to move around, space to jump, the mouse to look around, and the number keys for different visual effects.</p>
